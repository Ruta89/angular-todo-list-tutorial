## How to participate in this community-based course?

Do you want to do pull request with contribution to my code or even with a new feature? If yes, just follow these steps:

1. Fork my repo.
2. Make your changes in a new branch.
3. Push your branch to GitHub.
4. In GitHub, send a pull request either to branch tutorial-part-x (if you found a bug or you don't like my approach) or to master (if you are adding a new feature).

Also, take advantage of the utopian.io, which will allow you to get a reward for your contribution to this project. You do not have to write theoretical issues to what you have created. That's what I'll take care of. If your pull request is accepted, I will resteem your post and 30% of the reward from the part of the course which you have contributed to will go to you (if more than one pull request is accepted, the reward will be divided equally for all).

Of course, not only developers are welcome. In addition to the resteem, another 10% reward of each post will go to people who will publish other contributions to jakipatryk/angular-todo-list-tutorial project (e.g. a proven increase in course visability).
